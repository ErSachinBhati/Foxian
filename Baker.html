    <p>Winifred Mitchell Baker, born in 1957, serves as the Chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation. She is also the former CEO of the Mozilla Corporation, a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for overseeing the development of Mozilla's open-source internet applications, notably the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Baker stepped down from her role as CEO in February 2024. Baker was trained as a lawyer, Baker is actively involved in managing business and policy matters for both the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation. She holds a BA in Chinese studies from the University of California, Berkeley, and obtained her JD from the Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California, Berkeley. Baker has been recognized for her influence, being listed among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005. Before her roles at Mozilla, she worked in corporate and intellectual property law, including positions at Fenwick & West LLP and Sun Microsystems.</p>

    <p>In November 1994, Winifred Mitchell Baker joined Netscape Communications Corporation as one of its pioneering legal department employees. Working under CEO Jim Barksdale, she played a key role in establishing the department from the ground up. Baker's responsibilities included safeguarding intellectual property and handling legal matters related to product development, with direct reporting to the General Counsel. Additionally, she founded and oversaw the Technology Group within the Legal Department. Notably, Baker was deeply involved in the Mozilla project's inception, contributing to the creation of both the Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License.</p>

    <p>By February 1999, Baker assumed the position of general manager at mozilla.org, the division of Netscape dedicated to coordinating the Mozilla open source initiative. However, in 2001, she faced termination during a series of layoffs at America Online, Netscape's parent company at the time. Despite this setback, Baker remained committed to the Mozilla cause, continuing her role as general manager of mozilla.org on a voluntary basis.</p>

    <p>In November 2002, Winifred Mitchell Baker joined the Open Source Applications Foundation, where she played a pivotal role in fostering community relations and served on the organization's Board of Directors. Baker's influence extended to the creation of the Mozilla Foundation, an independent non-profit entity established on July 15, 2003. This move came in response to America Online's discontinuation of the Netscape browser division and reduced involvement in the Mozilla project. Baker assumed the role of President of the Mozilla Foundation and secured a seat on its five-person Board of Directors. Following the launch of the Mozilla Corporation on August 3, 2005, as a taxable subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation, Baker was appointed as its CEO. She concurrently retained her position on the Mozilla Corporation's Board of Directors and continued serving as Chairperson of the Mozilla Foundation. However, on January 8, 2008, due to Mozilla's rapid growth, Baker relinquished her CEO position at the Corporation, with John Lilly assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer. In April 2020, Baker resumed her role as CEO of the Mozilla Corporation. However, on February 8, 2024, Mozilla announced her resignation as CEO to concentrate on AI and internet safety initiatives while continuing her role as Chair of the Mozilla Foundation.</p>

    <p>In 2018, Winifred Mitchell Baker's compensation from Mozilla amounted to $2,458,350, marking a significant increase of 400% since 2008. However, during the same period, Firefox's market share declined by 85%. Responding to inquiries about her salary, Baker noted that she discovered her pay was approximately 80% below market standards, with comparable roles elsewhere offering salaries up to five times higher. She deemed such a significant gap unfair to employees and their families.</p>

    <p>Upon her return to the CEO position in 2020, Baker's salary surpassed $3 million. Subsequently, in 2021, her compensation further escalated to over $5 million, and by 2022, it nearly reached $7 million. Despite these substantial compensation increases, the Mozilla Corporation underwent significant layoffs in August 2020, affecting around 250 employees. Baker attributed these layoffs to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the corporation's revenue reaching record highs in 2019, while market share continued to decline.</p>
