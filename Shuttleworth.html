<p>Mark Richard Shuttleworth, born on September 18, 1973, is a prominent South African-British entrepreneur recognized as the founder and CEO of Canonical, the driving force behind the Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. Shuttleworth made headlines in 2002 when he became the first South African to journey into space, achieving this milestone as a space tourist. Residing on the Isle of Man, he holds dual citizenship in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The Sunday Times Rich List in 2020 estimated his wealth at approximately £500 million.

</p>

<p>Shuttleworth was born in Welkom, Free State, South Africa, to a surgeon and a nursery-school teacher. He attended Western Province Preparatory School and later Rondebosch Boys' High School and Bishops/Diocesan College, where he served as Head Boy in 1986 and 1991, respectively. Shuttleworth earned a Bachelor of Business Science degree in Finance and Information Systems from the University of Cape Town. During his time as a student, he played a role in installing the first residential Internet connections at the university.</p>

<p>In 1995, Shuttleworth established Thawte Consulting, a company specializing in digital certificates and Internet security. In December 1999, he sold Thawte to VeriSign, pocketing R3.5 billion (US$575 million, equivalent to $955 million in 2022). Following this success, in September 2000, he founded HBD Venture Capital (Here be Dragons), functioning as both a business incubator and a venture capital provider, now managed by Knife Capital.</p>

<p>In March 2004, Shuttleworth launched Canonical Ltd., aimed at promoting and providing commercial support for free software projects, particularly the Ubuntu operating system. In December 2009, he stepped down as CEO of Canonical Ltd., passing the reins to Jane Silber. However, in July 2017, at the conclusion of Silber's tenure, Shuttleworth resumed the role of CEO at Canonical.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Shuttleworth contributed as one of the developers of the Debian operating system. In 2001, he established the Shuttleworth Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to social innovation, which also supports educational and open-source software projects in South Africa, such as the Freedom Toaster. In 2004, Shuttleworth re-entered the free-software sphere by funding the development of Ubuntu, a Linux distribution based on Debian, through his company Canonical Ltd. He also founded the Ubuntu Foundation that year, initially investing $10 million. In the Ubuntu community, Shuttleworth humorously holds the title "Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life" (SABDFL). To recruit talent for the project, Shuttleworth spent six months analyzing Debian mailing list archives while traveling to Antarctica aboard the icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov in early 2004. In September 2005, he acquired a 65% stake in Impi Linux. On October 15, 2006, Shuttleworth was announced as the first patron of KDE, a significant sponsorship role. However, this association ended in 2012, along with financial support for Kubuntu, a KDE-based variant of Ubuntu. On December 17, 2009, Shuttleworth announced his decision to step down as CEO of Canonical, effective March 2010, to concentrate on product design, partnerships, and customers. Jane Silber, who had served as COO at Canonical since 2004, succeeded him as CEO. In September 2010, Shuttleworth received an honorary degree from the Open University for his contributions. On November 9, 2012, he participated in a debate at the Oxford Union titled "The Innovation Enigma" alongside Kenneth Rogoff, opposing Garry Kasparov and Peter Thiel. On October 25, 2013, Shuttleworth and Ubuntu were awarded the Austrian anti-privacy Big Brother Award for sending local Ubuntu Unity Dash searches to Canonical servers by default. However, he defended the anonymization method used in 2012. Later, he reversed the decision, and current Ubuntu versions do not perform this action.</p>

<p>Shuttleworth gained global recognition on April 25, 2002, when he became the second self-funded space tourist and the first South African to venture into space. Through Space Adventures, he boarded the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission as a spaceflight participant, paying approximately US$20 million for the journey (equivalent to $31.26 million in 2022). Two days later, the Soyuz spacecraft docked at the International Space Station, where he spent eight days conducting experiments related to AIDS and genome research. On May 5, 2002, he returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-33 after a year of training and preparation, including seven months in Star City, Russia.</p>

<p>During his spaceflight, Shuttleworth conversed with Thabo Mbeki, then president of South Africa, via video link as part of the Freedom Day celebrations commemorating the end of apartheid. He also engaged in a radio conversation with Nelson Mandela and a 14-year-old South African girl, Michelle Foster, who asked him to marry her. Politely sidestepping the question, he expressed gratitude before changing the subject. Foster, terminally ill, had the opportunity to converse with Shuttleworth and Mandela thanks to the Reach for a Dream foundation.</p>

<p>Shuttleworth owns a private jet, a Bombardier Global Express, often referred to as Canonical One, though it's actually owned through his HBD Venture Capital company. The jet is adorned with a dragon named Norman, the mascot of HBD Venture Capital.</p>

<p>In a significant financial move, Shuttleworth transferred R2.5 billion in capital from South Africa to the Isle of Man, prompting the South African Reserve Bank to impose a R250 million levy to release his assets. Following a legal battle, Shuttleworth initially won the case in the Supreme Court of Appeal, resulting in the return of the levy monies. However, the Constitutional Court of South Africa reversed this decision on June 18, 2015, ruling that the primary purpose of the exit charge was to regulate conduct rather than raise revenue, affirming its consistency with the Constitution.</p>
