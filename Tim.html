<p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee born on June 8, 1955, is a pioneering English computer scientist renowned for inventing the World Wide Web. His contributions include the creation of the HTML markup language, the URL system, and the HTTP protocol. Berners-Lee holds a position as a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and is a professor emeritus at MIT. On March 12, 1989, Berners-Lee proposed a groundbreaking information management system, leading to the first successful HTTP client-server communication over the Internet by mid-November of that year. He developed the initial Web browser and server, catalyzing the Web's rapid expansion. He is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which continues to guide the Web's evolution, and co-founded the World Wide Web Foundation with Rosemary Leith. In recognition of his work, he was elected as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences in April 2009. At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Berners-Lee is a senior researcher and holds the 3Com founder's chair. He also directs the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and serves on the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. <p>In 2011, he joined the Ford Foundation's board of trustees. Additionally, he founded and presides over the Open Data Institute and advises the social network MeWe. For his revolutionary contributions, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. He was awarded the 2016 Turing Award for inventing the World Wide Web and its foundational technologies. Time magazine recognized him as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, and he has received numerous other honors for his work.</p>

<p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was raised by parents who were both distinguished mathematicians and computer scientists, Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents, originally from Birmingham, were integral in developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. Berners-Lee's paternal grandmother hailed from Winnipeg, Canada. He has three younger siblings, including a brother, Mike, who is a professor specializing in ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee's early education began at Sheen Mount Primary School, followed by his attendance at Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, which was a direct grant grammar school at the time. As a child, he was an enthusiastic trainspotter and developed an interest in electronics by experimenting with a model railway. From 1973 to 1976, Berners-Lee attended The Queen's College, Oxford, where he earned a first-class BA in physics. During his time at Oxford, he exhibited his early ingenuity by creating a computer using parts from an old television set he acquired from a repair shop.
<p>
After completing his degree, Timothy Berners-Lee began his career as an engineer at Plessey, a telecommunications company in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he transitioned to D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he contributed to developing typesetting software for printers. In 1980, Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN in Geneva, from June to December. During his time at CERN, he proposed a project utilizing hypertext to enable easier sharing and updating of information among researchers. To illustrate his concept, he developed a prototype system called ENQUIRE. Following his initial stint at CERN, Berners-Lee joined John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset, where he managed the technical operations for three years. There, he worked on a project involving "real-time remote procedure call," which provided him with valuable experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow, resuming his groundbreaking work on information systems.</p>
<p>
In March 1989, Berners-Lee penned his proposal, which he later redistributed in 1990. Upon review, his manager at the time, Mike Sendall, characterized the proposals as "vague, but exciting," ultimately giving them the green light. Concurrently, Robert Cailliau, also at CERN, independently proposed a hypertext project and joined forces with Berners-Lee to advance the development of the World Wide Web. Leveraging concepts similar to those in the ENQUIRE system, they collaborated to bring the web to fruition, with Berners-Lee taking the lead in designing and constructing the inaugural web browser, WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system, and the pioneering web server, CERN HTTPd. On December 20, 1990, Berners-Lee published the first-ever website, housed within the CERN network, detailing the nascent World Wide Web project. The site offered insights into what the Web entailed, guidance on browser usage, server setup, and tips for creating personal websites. Subsequently, on August 6, 1991, Berners-Lee extended a public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project on Usenet.</p> 

<p>Recognizing the profound impact of his creation, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked as the foremost cultural moment shaping the modern world. The advent of this rapidly expanding communications medium revolutionized global connectivity, as stated by a panel of prominent figures. In 1994, Berners-Lee established the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT, comprising companies committed to enhancing web standards and recommendations. He championed an open approach, making his idea freely accessible without patent or royalty requirements, a philosophy that W3C continued by promoting royalty-free technology for widespread adoption. Berners-Lee also engaged in Curl Corp's endeavors to advance the Curl programming language. Additionally, in 2001, he became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, reflecting his ties to the region. Later, in December 2004, Berners-Lee assumed a chair in computer science at the University of Southampton, focusing on the development of the Semantic Web. In a lighthearted acknowledgment in October 2009, Berners-Lee conceded that the inclusion of the initial pair of slashes ("//") in web addresses was unnecessary, noting that he could have designed them differently. This admission underscored his humility and the iterative nature of technological innovation.</p>
<p>In June 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown unveiled a collaborative initiative between Tim Berners-Lee and the UK government aimed at enhancing data accessibility and openness on the Web. This endeavor built upon the groundwork laid by the Power of Information Task Force. Berners-Lee, alongside Professor Nigel Shadbolt, played pivotal roles in spearheading data.gov.uk, a government-backed project aimed at liberating nearly all official data for unrestricted reuse. Reflecting on the significance of opening up Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee emphasized a fundamental shift in governmental ethos, asserting that information should default to public accessibility unless justifiably restricted, not vice versa. He stressed that fostering greater transparency, accountability, and openness within government operations would empower citizens, offering them expanded choices and facilitating more direct engagement with matters of personal importance.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Tim Berners-Lee unveiled the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF), dedicated to championing the advancement of the Web as a force for positive transformation. The foundation's mission centers on launching innovative initiatives that empower communities to harness the Web's potential for social good, fostering local capacity-building efforts to drive meaningful change. Berners-Lee stands as a leading advocate for net neutrality, steadfast in his belief that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should offer unfettered connectivity without undue interference or surveillance of users' online activities. He contends that net neutrality embodies a fundamental human network right, emphasizing the imperative to safeguard against threats that compromise individuals' online freedoms. In a collaborative effort with 20 other Internet pioneers, Berners-Lee penned an open letter to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), urging the preservation of net neutrality principles and opposing proposed regulatory changes that could undermine an open and egalitarian Internet landscape. In a poignant moment during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Berners-Lee was celebrated as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web," symbolically depicted working alongside a vintage NeXT Computer. His iconic tweet, "This is for everyone," illuminated in LED lights adorning the audience's seats, underscored his vision of a universally accessible and inclusive Web ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee's diverse engagements continue to shape the digital landscape. He assumed an advisory role at the London-based start-up State.com, underscoring his commitment to fostering innovation in the tech sector. Additionally, he took the helm as president of the Open Data Institute, a venture he co-founded with Nigel Shadbolt in 2012, championing the ethos of data accessibility and transparency. In October 2013, Berners-Lee spearheaded the launch of the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), leading a coalition of both public and private entities, including tech giants like Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft. The A4AI aims to democratize Internet access, particularly in developing regions where connectivity remains limited. Berners-Lee's leadership focuses on driving down Internet access costs, striving to meet the UN Broadband Commission's target of ensuring that access is affordable, with prices falling below 5% of monthly income. </p>
<p>At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Berners-Lee occupies the prestigious Founders Chair in Computer Science. He heads the Decentralized Information Group and spearheads the Solid project, a collaboration with the Qatar Computing Research Institute.

Expanding his academic footprint, Berners-Lee joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University in October 2016, assuming the role of a professorial research fellow. Additionally, he became a fellow of Christ Church, one of Oxford's esteemed colleges, further solidifying his commitment to advancing research and education in the digital realm.</p>
<p>In the mid-2010s, Berners-Lee initially maintained a neutral stance on the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) proposal, which carried controversial implications regarding Digital Rights Management (DRM). However, in March 2017, he felt compelled to take a definitive position, ultimately lending support to the EME proposal. In justifying his stance, Berners-Lee highlighted the perceived benefits of EME while acknowledging the inevitability of DRM integration. As director of the W3C, he subsequently greenlit the finalized specification in July 2017, a decision met with opposition from entities such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the anti-DRM campaign Defective by Design, and the Free Software Foundation. Concerns raised ranged from perceived conflicts with the open philosophy of the Internet to the potential coercion of users into adopting specific web browsers for accessing DRM-protected content. Despite formal appeals lodged by the EFF, the EME specification attained formal W3C recommendation status in September 2017. On September 30, 2018, Berners-Lee unveiled his latest venture, the open-source startup Inrupt, aimed at cultivating a commercial ecosystem centered around the Solid project. Solid endeavors to empower users with greater control over their personal data, offering them the ability to dictate data access permissions, determine data destinations, and manage app access protocols. In November 2019, during the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, Berners-Lee, along with the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF), introduced the Contract for the Web initiative. This campaign seeks to rally governments, corporations, and individuals around nine core principles aimed at curtailing the misuse of the web. Berners-Lee underscored the imperative for collective action to thwart exploitation, division, and subversion of the web's potential for positive impact, emphasizing the need for concerted efforts to preserve its integrity and maximize its societal benefits.</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee's remarkable contributions to the advancement of technology have garnered him numerous awards and honors. In recognition of his pivotal role in shaping the global development of the Internet, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours and formally invested on 16 July 2004. Further acclaim followed with his appointment to the Order of Merit (OM) on 13 June 2007, a distinguished honor limited to 24 living members, in addition to any honorary members. Membership in the Order of Merit is a personal prerogative of the Sovereign and does not necessitate recommendation by governmental officials. Berners-Lee's exceptional contributions to science and technology have earned him fellowship in esteemed institutions such as the Royal Society (FRS), where he was elected in 2001.

<p>Tim Berners-Lee maintains a clear demarcation between his professional endeavors and personal life, stating, "I like to keep work and personal life separate." In 1990, Berners-Lee tied the knot with Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer also engaged in work at the World Health Organization in Switzerland. The couple, who welcomed two children together, eventually parted ways and finalized their divorce in 2011. Following this, in 2014, Berners-Lee exchanged vows with Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. Leith, a Canadian entrepreneur with a background in Internet and banking, serves as a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. Beyond their personal union, the couple collaborates on ventures related to venture capital, particularly in support of artificial intelligence companies. Although raised in the Anglican faith, Berners-Lee distanced himself from religious affiliation during his youth. However, upon becoming a parent, he embraced Unitarian Universalism (UU). When queried about his belief in God, Berners-Lee candidly stated, "Not in the sense of most people, I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist." In a groundbreaking development, the source code of the web, authored by Berners-Lee, was auctioned by Sotheby's in London as a non-fungible token (NFT) from June 23 to June 30, 2021. Sold for a staggering sum of US$5,434,500, the proceeds from this historic auction were earmarked to fund initiatives spearheaded by Berners-Lee and Leith, showcasing their commitment to driving impactful projects forward.</p>
