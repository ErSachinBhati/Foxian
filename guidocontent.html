    <p>Guido van Rossum, born on January 31, 1956, is a Dutch programmer renowned as the creator of Python, a widely used programming language. He served as its "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) until stepping down on July 12, 2018. He continued as a member of the Python Steering Council until 2019 and opted out of nominations for the 2020 election.</p>

    <p>Van Rossum grew up in the Netherlands and earned a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. Notably, he won a bronze medal in the 1974 International Mathematical Olympiad. He has a brother named Just van Rossum, who is both a type designer and programmer, responsible for designing the typeface used in the "Python Powered" logo.</p>

    <p>Currently residing in Belmont, California, with his wife, Kim Knapp, and their son, van Rossum follows Dutch naming conventions where the "van" in his surname is capitalized when used alone but not when combined with his first name.</p>

    <p>During his time at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Van Rossum contributed to BSD Unix in 1986 with a glob() routine and was involved in the development of the ABC programming language. He acknowledged ABC's influence, highlighting his gratitude to the project and its contributors. Additionally, he created Grail, an early Python-based web browser, and participated in discussions on the HTML standard. Van Rossum's career includes stints at various research institutions such as CWI in the Netherlands, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). In 2000, he joined BeOpen.com with three other Python developers but left after its collapse later that year. Subsequently, he worked at Zope Corporation until 2003, after which he moved to Elemental Security, where he focused on developing a custom programming language.</p>

    <p>From 2005 to December 2012, Guido van Rossum was at Google, spending half his time enhancing Python. During his tenure, he created Mondrian, a Python-based code review system named after the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian. He also named another project after the Dutch designer Gerrit Rietveld. However, on December 7, 2012, he departed from Google.</p>

    <p>In January 2013, Guido van Rossum joined Dropbox, a cloud file storage company. He worked there until October 2019 when he retired officially.</p>

    <p>On November 12, 2020, Guido van Rossum announced his return from retirement to join Microsoft's Developer Division. He now holds the title of Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft.</p>

    <p>In December 1989, Guido van Rossum sought a programming project to occupy his time during the Christmas break when his office was closed. He decided to create an interpreter for a new scripting language inspired by ABC, which he thought would appeal to Unix/C hackers. He chose the name "Python" somewhat whimsically, influenced by his love for Monty Python's Flying Circus. Van Rossum explained that Python's precursor, ABC, drew inspiration from SETL, mentioning that co-developer Lambert Meertens had spent time with the SETL group at NYU before finalizing ABC's design. On July 12, 2018, Van Rossum announced his decision to step down from the role of BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) of the Python programming language.</p>

    <p>In 1999, Guido van Rossum proposed "Computer Programming for Everybody" to DARPA, outlining his vision for Python: Creation of an easy and intuitive language with comparable power to major competitors. Open-source nature, enabling contributions from anyone. Code readability akin to plain English. Apt for everyday tasks, facilitating rapid development. By 2019, Python had become the second most popular language on GitHub, trailing only JavaScript. It consistently ranks in the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings, according to surveys. Moreover, Python has maintained a spot among the top 10 most popular programming languages since 2004, and in October 2021, it secured the number one position on the TIOBE Programming Community Index.</p>
