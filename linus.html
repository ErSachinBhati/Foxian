    <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds, born on December 28, 1969, is a Finnish-American software engineer renowned for creating the Linux kernel, a fundamental component of the widely used Linux operating system. Torvalds also developed Git, a distributed version control system crucial for modern software development. In recognition of his groundbreaking contributions to technology, Torvalds was co-awarded the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012 by the Technology Academy Finland, alongside Shinya Yamanaka. This prestigious honor acknowledged his role in developing an open-source operating system that has significantly impacted computing. Further cementing his legacy, Torvalds received the IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award in 2014 and the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award in 2018.</p>
    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>Linus Torvalds' parents, Anna and Nils Torvalds, were both journalists and active on campus during their time at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. Linus comes from a family with a background in statistics, poetry, journalism, and military service. He grew up in a Swedish-speaking minority community in Finland.</p>
    <p>His interest in computers sparked at the age of 11 when he got his hands on a VIC-20 in 1981. He began programming in BASIC and later delved into machine code without using assembly language. Linus extensively modified a Sinclair QL, writing his own assembler, editor, and even some games due to the scarcity of software in Finland.</p>
    <p>After graduating from the University of Helsinki in 1996 with a master's degree in computer science, Torvalds embarked on his journey in the tech world. His academic career was momentarily interrupted when he served in the Finnish Navy as an artillery observer during his mandatory military service. During this time, he acquired Andrew Tanenbaum's book "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation," which introduced him to MINIX, a simplified version of Unix.</p>
    <h2>Career and Achievements</h2>
    <p>In 1990, Torvalds returned to university and was exposed to Unix through a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX. His master's thesis titled "Linux: A Portable Operating System" laid the groundwork for what would become one of the most significant contributions to computing history. It was in 1991, shortly after purchasing an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC, that he began working on what we now know as Linux.</p>
    <p>In late 1996, Torvalds visited Transmeta and subsequently joined the company in California from February 1997 to June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which later merged with the Free Standards Group to form the Linux Foundation, where he continues his work. Torvalds relocated to Dunthorpe, Oregon, in June 2004, to be closer to the Linux Foundation's headquarters. From 1997 to 1999, Torvalds was involved in 86open, helping establish standard binary formats for Linux and Unix. In 1999, he was recognized by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators under age 35. That same year, Red Hat and VA Linux, key developers of Linux-based software, awarded Torvalds stock options as a token of gratitude. When both companies went public that year, Torvalds's shares briefly soared to about US$20 million.</p>
    <p>Torvalds's personal mascot is a penguin named Tux, widely embraced by the Linux community as the symbol of the Linux kernel. Despite his belief in open source, Torvalds acknowledges using the "best tool for the job," even if it's proprietary software. He faced criticism for using the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel, leading him to develop a free-software alternative called Git.</p>
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds, a former Finnish national karate champion, and they have three daughters. Torvalds describes himself as atheist and agnostic, expressing skepticism about religion's role in shaping morals and appreciation of nature. He relocated with his family to Portland, Oregon, in 2004, and became a United States citizen in 2010, remaining unaffiliated with any political party. Torvalds developed an interest in scuba diving in the early 2000s and has achieved multiple certifications, leading him to create the Subsurface project.</p>
