        <p>Richard Matthew Stallman, born March 16, 1953, also known by his initials RMS, is an American programmer and free software movement activist. In 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom and has since dedicated his time to advocating for free software. Stallman is critical of software patents, digital rights management, and other systems that restrict user freedoms.</p>
        <p>Stallman resigned as president of the FSF and left his role at MIT in September 2019 following controversial comments about the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. However, he continued to lead the GNU Project and returned to the FSF board of directors in 2021.</p>
        <p>Stallman was born in New York City on March 16, 1953. He came from a Jewish family but didn't feel at home with his parents. He got into computers early, even reading manuals for the IBM 7094 as a kid at summer camp.</p>
        <p>In high school, he attended a program at Columbia University and worked as a lab assistant at Rockefeller University. Though he was good at math and physics, his professor thought he could excel in biology.</p>
        <p>His first real computer job was at the IBM New York Scientific Center during high school. He was hired to write a program in Fortran but ended up disliking the language. Instead, he spent most of the summer creating a text editor and a preprocessor for another programming language called PL/I on the IBM System/360.</p>
        <p>Stallman did well in his first year at Harvard University, especially in Math 55. He felt happy and at home there. In 1971, during his first year at Harvard, he started working as a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>
        <p>He became a regular in the hacker community and was known by his initials, RMS. Stallman graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1974. Initially, Stallman thought about continuing his studies at Harvard, but he chose to enroll as a graduate student at MIT instead. He started a physics doctorate program but left to focus on programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.</p>
        <p>While working as a research assistant at MIT from 1975, Stallman and his colleague Gerry Sussman published a paper in 1977 about an AI system called dependency-directed backtracking, which was a breakthrough in solving complex problems. Stallman also worked on various software projects at MIT, including TECO and Emacs for the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS), as well as the Lisp machine operating system.</p>
        <p>Stallman didn't like restricted computer access in the lab, which was primarily funded by DARPA. He famously decrypted passwords to encourage anonymous access to systems, although ultimately passwords remained in use. Stallman was proud of his efforts to promote open access to computers.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker community Stallman was part of started to break apart. Many companies stopped sharing their software's inner workings to keep it exclusive to their own machines. They began using copyright and strict licenses to control who could copy or share the software. This shift was influenced by the US Copyright Act of 1976.</p>
        <p>When Brian Reid added restrictions to the Scribe software in 1979, Stallman strongly opposed it, seeing it as an infringement on people's freedoms. He believed that users should have the freedom to modify and share software, which inspired him to create texinfo, a replacement for Scribe, which he completed in 1986.</p>
        <p>In 1980, Stallman and other hackers at the AI Lab were denied access to the source code for a new laser printer. This incident convinced Stallman that users should have the ability to modify the software they use freely.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, disagreements arose among AI Lab hackers about the direction of the Lisp machine project. Richard Greenblatt, one of the hackers, started Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI), while others formed Symbolics. Stallman believed LMI was more community-friendly. He worked independently from 1982 to 1983 to prevent Symbolics from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.</p>
        <p>Stallman argues that software users should be able to share, study, and modify the software they use freely. He sees attempts to restrict these freedoms by proprietary software vendors as unethical.</p>
        <p>In February 1984, Stallman left his job at MIT to focus on the GNU project, which he had announced the year before. He remained associated with MIT as a visiting scientist until around 1998.</p>
        <p>Stallman kicked off the GNU project in September 1983 by sharing his plans on various online forums. He believed he was the right person for the job because of his skills as an operating system developer. His goal was to create an operating system compatible with Unix so that users could easily switch to it.</p>
        <p>In 1985, he penned the GNU Manifesto, detailing why he was creating a free operating system called GNU. He founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) as a nonprofit organization to support the project. Stallman pushed the concept of copyleft to safeguard the rights of free software users, leading to the creation of the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
        <p>Stallman developed essential tools for the GNU system, like GNU Emacs and GCC. Although a kernel was missing, in 1990, the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon's Mach microkernel for GNU Hurd. Meanwhile, in 1991, Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel, which combined with GNU's tools to create what many know as Linux.</p>
        <p>Stallman insists on calling it GNU/Linux to recognize the GNU project's contribution. He's been a strong advocate for free software, even amid controversies like the naming debate and disagreements over software philosophy.</p>
        <p>Stallman's activism extends beyond software. He's campaigned for digital rights and against proprietary technology. He's protested against companies like ATI and Sony for their practices. Stallman has also advocated for user privacy, often using unconventional methods like avoiding mobile phones and key cards.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Stallman faced criticism and resigned from MIT and FSF due to remarks made in the context of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Despite this, he returned to the FSF board in 2021, leading to both support and opposition within the open-source community.</p>
